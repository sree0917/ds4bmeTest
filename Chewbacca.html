'''Chewbacca''' ({{IPAc-en|t É|uÀê|Àà|b|…ëÀê|k|…ô}}), nicknamed "'''Chewie'''", is a fictional character in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' franchise. He is a [[wookiee]], a tall, hirsute, bipedal, intelligent species originating from the fictional planet of [[Kashyyyk]]. Chewbacca is the loyal friend and [[first mate]] of [[Han Solo]], and serves as [[First officer (aviation)|co-pilot]] on Solo's spaceship, the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]''; together they help the [[Rebel Alliance]] defeat the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]] and restore freedom to [[Star Wars galaxy|the galaxy]].&lt;ref name="profile" /&gt;

In the [[original trilogy]], Chewbacca is portrayed by [[Peter Mayhew]]. Mayhew shares the role with his body double, [[Joonas Suotamo]], in the first episode of the [[sequel trilogy]], ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]''. Suotamo took over the role in the next episode, ''[[The Last Jedi]],''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why We Still Love Star Wars: A New Chewie|work=[[Parade magazine]]|date=December 3, 2017|pages=8|quote=Now Joonas Sutamo,....,has taken over the suit full-time from 73-year old actor Peter Mayhew.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reprised it in the anthology film ''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story]]'' and the final sequel trilogy film, ''[[The Rise of Skywalker]]''. The character has also appeared in numerous works within the [[Star Wars expanded to other media|Expanded Universe]], consisting of television series, books, comics, and video games.

==Character==
Chewbacca, a 200-year-old [[wookiee]], becomes a young [[Han Solo]]'s companion after they both escape Imperial captivity on Mimban. After a series of adventures on Vandor and [[Kessel (Star Wars)|Kessel]], Chewbacca embarks on the smuggling trade, serving as Han's co-pilot on the ''Millennium Falcon'' for the rest of Han's life.&lt;ref name="profile"&gt;[http://www.starwars.com/databank/chewbacca Chewbacca Profile] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151221133837/http://www.starwars.com/databank/chewbacca |date=2015-12-21 }}, at StarWars.com. Retrieved May 30, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Standing at eight feet tall, Chewbacca is covered with long hair and wears only a [[bandolier]]. His weapon of choice is the Wookiee bowcaster (a [[crossbow]]-shaped [[directed-energy weapon]]).&lt;ref name="sweet"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Star Wars Encyclopedia |first=Stephen J. |last=Sansweet |isbn=0-345-40227-8 |publisher=Del Rey |date=1998-06-30 |edition=1st |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/starwarsencyclop00sans }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chewbacca speaks only in his native language, Shyriiwook (which sounds like animal sound growls); he is able to understand English, but is physically unable to speak it.

Chewbacca was named one of the "greatest [[sidekick]]s" in film history by ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Schott, ''Schott's Miscellany Calendar 2009'' (New York: Workman Publishing, 2008), March 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In other countries===
In [[France]], in the [[Star Wars (film)|original ''Star Wars'' film]], his name was changed to "'''Chiktabba'''"&lt;ref&gt;http://cinema.jeuxactu.com/news-cinema-star-wars-quand-chewbacca-s-appelait-chiktaba-et-han-solo-yan-28943.htm&lt;/ref&gt; because the English name was similar to "chewing tobacco", which means in French "tabac √† m√¢cher" or "tabac √† chiquer", similar to "Chiktabba". In the other episodes, his name was "Chewbacca".

In the [[Italian language|Italian-language]] editions, Chewbacca is named "'''Chewbecca'''" ({{IPA-it|t Éub…õkka/t Éubekka}}) and is nicknamed "'''Chewbe'''" ({{IPA-it|t Éube}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.guerrestellari.net/athenaeum/stori_menucronicreativa_dopp.html|title=La Guerra delle stelle: Il doppiaggio e l'adattamento italiano di Star Wars del '77|website=Star Wars Athenaeum|language=it|author=Lorenzo Frati|access-date=November 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==
Chewbacca's creation as a "gentle, [[hairy]], non-English-speaking co-pilot" was inspired by [[George Lucas]] seeing his own dog sitting up on the passenger seat of his car.&lt;ref&gt;George Lucas, in DVD bonus disc documentary, "Characters of Star Wars"&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that Chewbacca's name is derived from ''—Å–æ–±–∞–∫–∞'' (sobaka), the [[slavic languages|Russian]] word for ''dog''.&lt;ref name="Russian"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsmarts.com/movies/starwars/c_chewbacca.html|title=FilmSmarts.com - Chewbacca from Star Wars|work=filmsmarts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his first six screen appearances, Chewbacca was played by [[Peter Mayhew]], who was chosen for his height of 7'3" (2.2 m).&lt;ref name="BONUS"&gt;''The Characters of Star Wars'' Star Wars Original Trilogy DVD Box Set: Bonus Materials&lt;/ref&gt;  Five similar costumes were created for Mayhew: in the three original films and [[Star Wars Holiday Special|a holiday special]], the suits were made of [[yak]] hair and [[mohair]]. In ''[[Star Wars: Episode III ‚Äì Revenge of the Sith|Revenge of the Sith]]'' (2005), the suit was made of more comfortable materials, though Mayhew's filming only lasted a day. Only Mayhew's blue eyes could be seen in his costume, but fans easily recognize him by his gestures, and his co-workers claimed the ability to tell when a stand-in was taking his place.&lt;ref name="PMB"&gt;[http://www.screenrush.co.uk/personne/fichepersonne_gen_cpersonne=68258.html Peter Mayhew Biography], at Screenrush. Retrieved January 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; For ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens|The Force Awakens]]'', the role was also shared by [[Joonas Suotamo]], who subsequently portrayed the character in later screen appearances after Mayhew's retirement.

Chewbacca's voice was created by the original films' [[sound designer]], [[Ben Burtt]], from recordings of [[walrus]]es, lions, [[camel]]s, bears, rabbits, tigers, and [[badger]]s in Burtt's personal [[menagerie]].&lt;ref name="PMB"/&gt; The individual recordings were mixed at different ratios for Chewbacca's different utterances. One of the most prominent elements in the voice was a [[American black bear|black bear]] named Tarik, from [[Happy Hollow Zoo]] in [[San Jose, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/character/chewbacca/?id=bts|title=Chewbacca|work=StarWars.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original costume was created by [[Stuart Freeborn]] and his wife Kay Freeborn, who hand knitted the torso section. During preproduction of ''The Force Awakens'', Creature Effects Supervisor [[Neal Scanlan]] commented that the original suit was far more sophisticated than they had originally realized, leading him to entirely scrap their first attempt at making the new suit, go back and study Freeborn's work in order to better appreciate how it worked, and attempt to emulate it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Poland|first1=David|title=DP/30: Star Wars: The Force Awakens - The On-Set FX Supervisors |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1M2KM-lE_g |website= [[YouTube]] |access-date=15 January 2016 |location= Los Angeles |format= Video interview |date=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearances==
===Skywalker saga===
{{main|Skywalker Saga}}

====Original trilogy====

First appearing in ''Star Wars'' (1977),{{EpIV}} Chewbacca and Han Solo accept a charter to take [[Luke Skywalker]], [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], and [[droid (Star Wars)|droids]] [[C-3PO]] and [[R2-D2]] to the planet [[Alderaan]] aboard their ship, the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Star Wars Episode IV''&lt;/ref&gt; When they find the planet destroyed by the [[Death Star]], the two smugglers help their passengers rescue [[Princess Leia]] and take her to the Rebel base on [[Yavin IV]]. In the film's [[Battle of Yavin|climactic battle scene]], Chewbacca and Han save Luke from being killed by [[Darth Vader]] and give him time to destroy the [[Death Star]]. In the film's final scene, Princess Leia acknowledges Chewbacca alongside Luke and Han.

In ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980), set three years later, Chewbacca tries to leave the Rebellion along with Han in order to repay Jabba, but is drawn back into the war when the Empire invaded the Rebel base on [[Hoth]]. Chewbacca and the other protagonists seek refuge on [[Bespin|Cloud City]] with Han's old friend [[Lando Calrissian]], unaware that Lando has betrayed them to the Empire. Chewbacca finds a dismantled C-3PO, blasted by an [[Imperial stormtrooper]], in a junk pile, and rescues him from being melted down. He tries to repair him, to no avail, shortly before Vader takes Chewbacca and the others prisoner. Before Han is frozen in carbonite, he asks Chewbacca to look after Leia for him. When Lando is able to save Leia and Chewbacca from being taken to Vader's ship, he uncuffs the Wookie, who upon release starts strangling him for selling them out. When Lando explains that they still have a chance to save Han, Leia has Chewbacca stop choking him. Even though they are unsuccessful at saving the frozen Han, they make it back to the ''Falcon'' with R2-D2. Chewbacca carries C-3PO on his back throughout their escape to the ''Falcon''. When Leia hears Luke's cry for help, she has Chewbacca turn the ship around to rescue him. In the film's final scene, Chewbacca joins the others in preparing to rescue Han from Jabba.

In ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' (1983), Chewbacca pretends to be the prisoner of a bounty hunter named Boushh, who is actually Leia in disguise. Chewbacca helps Leia, Luke and the others rescue Han and escape. Later, he goes with the others to the forest moon of [[Endor (Star Wars)|Endor]] on a mission to destroy the second Death Star's shield generator, and is instrumental in the mission's success by commandeering an [[Walker (Star Wars)#All Terrain Scout Transport (AT-ST)|AT-ST Walker]]. At the end of the film, Chewbacca joins the other Rebels in celebrating the destruction of the Death Star and the downfall of the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;''Star Wars Episodes V'' &amp; ''VI''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Prequel trilogy====
In the 2005 [[Star Wars prequel trilogy|prequel film]] ''[[Star Wars: Episode III ‚Äì Revenge of the Sith]]'', Chewbacca and [[List of Star Wars Old Republic characters#Tarfful|Tarfful]] fight in the [[Clone Wars (Star Wars)|Clone Wars]] when their planet, [[Kashyyyk]], is invaded by the Separatist Alliance. They also help  [[Yoda]] escape the clone troopers that had been ordered to kill him. Chewbacca is not identified until Yoda says goodbye to him at the end of a scene.

====Sequel trilogy====
On April 7, 2014, it was confirmed that Mayhew would reprise his role as Chewbacca in ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]''.

In the film, set 30 years after ''Return of the Jedi'', he and Han are piloting a cargo vessel and find the ''Millennium Falcon'', which had been stolen from them. Chewbacca and Han help the rogue [[First Order (Star Wars)|First Order]] stormtrooper [[Finn (Star Wars)|Finn]], the scavenger [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]] and the droid [[BB-8]] escape from a gang of mercenaries on board the ''Falcon''. They then fly to [[Maz Kanata]]'s castle so that Maz can help them get BB-8 to the [[Resistance (Star Wars)|Resistance]]. Before Chewbacca and the others can get Maz's help, however, the First Order attacks the castle and captures Rey while Chewbacca, Finn, and Han are saved by [[X-wing]] pilots led by [[Poe Dameron]]. Without Rey, they fly to a Resistance base, where Chewbacca and Han reunite with Leia, C-3PO, and R2-D2. They also soon reunite with Rey, who escaped from the First Order. Chewbacca helps in the fight between the Resistance and First Order. When Han is killed by his son [[Kylo Ren]] during the battle, an enraged Chewbacca shoots Ren in the side, and sets off explosives that allow Poe and other X-wing pilots to destroy Starkiller Base, the First Order's superweapon. Chewbacca shortly thereafter rescues Rey and Finn from the wilderness of Starkiller Base following their duel with Ren. As Starkiller Base blows up, Chewbacca escapes in the ''Falcon'' with Finn and Rey, and later, along with R2-D2, helps Rey find Luke on the planet Ahch-To.

Chewbacca returns in ''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi]],'' which takes place immediately after ''The Force Awakens''. He attempts to convince Luke to train Rey as a Jedi and defeat the First Order, though Luke refuses. Chewbacca is seen in and around the ''Falcon'' throughout the Ahch-To scenes, where he develops a relationship with the planet's indigenous seabirds known as Porgs. Later on, Chewbacca and Rey set off on the ''Falcon'' to [[Supreme Leader Snoke]]'s ''Mega''-class Star Dreadnought ''Supremacy'', during Rey's attempt to turn Kylo Ren back to the light. Chewbacca later helps the Resistance fight the First Order's fleet; he pilots the ''Falcon'' as part of a plan to distract the First Order TIE fighters. After Rey and Luke defeat the First Order, Chewbacca is seen along with the rest of the Resistance as the ''Falcon'' flies away from the battle.

Chewbacca appears in [[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker|''The Rise of Skywalker'']], now played solely by Suotamo. Chewbacca accompanies Rey, Finn, Poe, and C-3PO to the planet Passana, where they search for a clue to the location of a [[Sith]] Wayfinder. With the help of Lando Calrissian, they locate the clue - a dagger with Sith inscriptions - but are quickly found by the First Order. As Rey confronts Kylo Ren, Chewbacca, who has the dagger, is captured by the Knights of Ren and taken aboard a transport to the ''Resurgent''-class Star Destroyer ''Steadfast''. Believing him to be on a different transport, Rey and Ren both use [[Force (Star Wars)|the Force]] to pull it down, with Rey accidentally using [[Force lightning]] to destroy the ship; Rey is deeply shaken when she believes she has killed Chewbacca, and his "death" motivates the others to continue the mission in his memory. Chewbacca is in reality taken to the command ship, where he is questioned about his friends' whereabouts; Rey senses his presence when the ship arrives on Kijimi, and Finn and Poe stow aboard the ship to rescue him. Later on, after Rey abandons them on Kef-Bir, they return to the Resistance base, where Chewbacca is distraught to learn of Leia's death. He joins the Resistance in defeating and destroying the Sith Eternal forces. He is last seen receiving Han's old medal (given to him in ''A New Hope'') from Maz Kanata. The medal is a token of gratitude for his long-term service to the rebellion as well as a memento through which to remember his fallen old friends Han, Luke and Leia.

===Anthology films===
====''Solo: A Star Wars Story'' ====

Chewbacca appears in the 2018 anthology film ''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story]]'', which details his first meeting with Han. He first appears as a "beast" captured by Imperials on the planet Mimban, where he is held captive in a small pit. Han, considered a "troublemaker" by the other Imperials, is thrown into the pit and chained to Chewbacca to be eaten by the Wookiee. Chewbacca emerges and attacks Han, but stops when Han reveals he can speak Shyriiwook. They form an instant bond, and escape their captors. They then decide to join the thief Tobias Beckett and his crew, who can free them. Chewbacca later helps Han and Beckett's crew on their failed mission to steal coaxium for the Crimson Dawn crime syndicate. Later, on Kessel, during an effort to retrieve more coaxium to make up for the amount lost during the previous mission, Chewbacca spots several other Wookiees being held as slaves, and manages to free them. However, while making a choice whether to go with them or with Han, Chewbacca decides to assist Han instead, and helps him throughout the rest of the mission. During the Kessel Run, in which Han decides to pilot the ''Millennium Falcon'' through a cloudy maelstrom to evade an Imperial blockade, Chewbacca reveals his piloting skills to Han. Near the end of the movie, Beckett, now revealed to be a traitor, captures Chewbacca, Han saves Chewbacca and kills Beckett. Han and Chewbacca then set off on more adventures in the ''Falcon''.

In contrast, [[Roger Ebert]] in his 1997 review of the Special Edition re-release of ''The Empire Strikes Back'' declared that the character gave the worst performance of the film: "This character was thrown into the first film as window dressing, was never thought through, and as a result has been saddled with one facial expression and one mournful yelp. Much more could have been done. How can you be a space pilot and not be able to communicate in any meaningful way? Does Han Solo really understand Chew's monotonous noises? Do they have long chats sometimes?"&lt;ref name="Ebert Review"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19970221/REVIEWS/702210302/1023 |title=The Empire Strikes Back |author=Roger Ebert |date=21 February 1997 |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|access-date=29 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Awards===
Chewbacca is one of the few fictional characters to receive a [[Lifetime Achievement Award]] at the [[1997 MTV Movie Awards]]. Because fans complained that he should have received a medal along with Luke and Han at the end of ''A New Hope'', [[MTV]] presented the award as a medal bestowed by [[Carrie Fisher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chilton|first1=Martin|date=13 December 2011|title=Chewbacca film on Hollywood Black List|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/8953702/Chewbacca-film-on-Hollywood-Black-List.html|access-date=19 August 2020|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Mayhew had voiced concern about Chewbacca being skipped in the original medal scene as well, but noted that Chewbacca does get the last "line" in the film as compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=18 October 2005|title='Star Wars' actor, others pledge their allegiance|page=B2|newspaper=[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
